/**
 * QR for a gift destination (a bare address, or a BIP-21 URI).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT theme-aware. The rest of the app inverts in dark mode; this
 * stays black-on-white always, because an inverted QR is a scanning
 * compatibility gamble on the donor's camera app and the downside is a failed
 * gift. `marginSize={4}` is the quiet zone the QR spec requires — the
 * container padding is cosmetic and does not substitute for it, since a
 * scanner reads the SVG's own bounds when the image is saved or screenshotted.
 *
 * `value` must already be validated by gift.ts. This renders whatever it is
 * handed, so handing it an unvalidated address just produces a scannable
 * wrong answer.
